Now currently Sacramento as a full-time dev! I have an older sister, step-brother and a 3 year old dog, Atlas. As more of an independent person, I enjoy food, music, exercising, traveling, sports, and growing as a person everyday. Summer of 2017, after a road-trip to Kentucky while visiting friends with a buddy of mine, that's when I was inspired to finally commit my life to computer programming and web development. I have always carried a nerdy side to me, always craving the latest tech - beginning with Gameboy's and Gamecube's since the 90's. None of my schools taught any coding while growing up. And true enough, it was never in my hearts passion throughout my early twenties. But now, one day, I would love to engineer for something upcoming and unique like the blockchain industry to help expand its potential revolutionary uses. Programming for the sports industry is my other dream as well. I'm 29, haven't been taking life for granted for a some time now, and today is the first day of the rest of my life. The journey feels perfect because I feel I can accomplish anything after understanding coding and how the internet works."))}}}]);
